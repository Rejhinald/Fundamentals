# Fundamentals
This repository is my personal collection of notes and a web app centered around learning the fundamentals of TypeScript (with Next.js/React), Tailwind CSS, and Node.js for the backend. It's a space for me to experiment, practice, and deepen my understanding of these core web development technologies.


## Initial Goals
[] Follow Course Guides -- so expect multiple unrelated files  

## First Goal after the Course Guides  
[] Set up a NextJS framework web app.  
[] Learn the fundamentals of typescript without any help of AI. (Search only in documentations for problem solving)  
[] Learn the fundamentals of Tailwind CSS / CSS   
[] Setup a good landing page without any help of UIs and AI.  

## Future Goals
[] User auth using node.js postgresql  
[] Setup CRUD (blog type)  

## Learning fundamentals:
