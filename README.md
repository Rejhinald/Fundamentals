# Fundamentals
This repository is my personal collection of notes and a web app centered around learning the fundamentals of TypeScript (with Next.js/React), Tailwind CSS, and Node.js for the backend. It's a space for me to experiment, practice, and deepen my understanding of these core web development technologies.
