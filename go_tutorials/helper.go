package main

// in a helper.go file we can put the function 
// that we want to use in the main.go file
// because the code will be cleaner and easier to read

// we can also put the function in the main.go file
// but it will make the code more complex and harder to read
// because the main.go file will be longer

// will not put the functions in here because
// i am just following a tutorial where i just need to grasp
// the concept of the code

// this can organize the app, and logically group our code
